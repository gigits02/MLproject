We implemented a NN, trained on a developer set that is 80% of the provided TR set and tested over an internal test set (20% of TR records).
First we used a grid search with 5-fold CV (with early stopping condition over MSE) to select the best parameters. The grid search tests hidden layers, learning rate, momentum, regulation
and activation function. The best parameters are selected to retrain the model without ES.
The model uses mini-batch training, L2 regularization and Nesterov momentum as well as a decaying learning rate.
Finally we tested the model over the internal test and made predictions over the blind test.
