# Machine Learning Exam – Academic Year 2025/2026

This repository contains the material developed for the **Machine Learning exam (a.y. 2025–2026)**. The exam consists of two independent tasks:

* **CUP**: a **regression** problem solved using a neural network implemented *from scratch*;
* **MONK**: a **classification** problem based on the MONK datasets, solved using a neural network implemented *from scratch*.

The entire project is developed in **plain Python**, without relying on high-level machine learning libraries (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn), in compliance with the exam requirements.

## CUP – Regression task

The `CUP/` directory contains all the material related to the CUP regression problem.

### 📁 CUP_datasets/

This folder contains the **raw dataset files**, separated into:

* **training** files;
* **test** files.

These files are not modified directly and represent the base input for all experiments.

### 📁 GridSearch/

This folder contains the code and outputs related to hyperparameter tuning:

* `grid.py`

  * performs a **grid search** over the main neural network hyperparameters;
  * stores the results (hyperparameter configurations and validation metrics) into output files.

* `sortGrid.py`

  * post-processes the grid search results;
  * sorts configurations by **increasing validation loss**, making model selection easier.

The files generated by these scripts are included in the folder.

### 📄 crossVal.py

Main script for training and evaluating the model using **k-fold cross-validation**.

Main functionalities:

* neural network definition;
* *from-scratch* training procedure;
* performance evaluation averaged across folds;
* support for hyperparameter assessment.

This script is intended for experimental analysis and model validation.

### 📄 finalTest.py

Script used for the **final evaluation** of the selected model.

Main steps:

* training the neural network on the full training set;
* testing on the CUP test dataset;
* generation of the final output file:

```
output_test.csv
```

containing the required predictions for submission.

## MONK – Classification task

The `MONK/` directory contains all the material related to the MONK classification problem.

### 📁 Original_MonkFiles/

Contains the **original MONK dataset files**, exactly as provided, without any modification.

### 📁 Encoded_MonkFiles/

Contains the MONK datasets after **one-hot encoding**, which are directly used by the neural network.

### 📄 oneHotEnc.py

Pre-processing script that:

* reads the original MONK files;
* applies **one-hot encoding** to categorical features;
* saves the processed datasets into the `Encoded_MonkFiles/` folder.

### 📄 monk.py

Main script for the MONK problem.

Main functionalities:

* neural network construction for classification;
* *from-scratch* training procedure;
* testing on the MONK datasets;
* printing and/or saving performance metrics.

---

## Requirements and execution

* Language: **Python 3**
* Libraries: only standard libraries (e.g. `math`, `random`, `csv`, `itertools`, `numpy` if allowed)
* No high-level machine learning frameworks are used.

Scripts can be executed directly from the terminal, for example:

```bash
python crossVal.py
python finalTest.py
python monk.py
```

(from their respective directories).

---

## Final notes

* The project structure is designed to clearly separate **data**, **pre-processing**, **validation**, and **final testing**.
* All neural networks are implemented manually, in full compliance with the exam constraints.
* The folder organization allows for an easy and transparent inspection of the full workflow.
